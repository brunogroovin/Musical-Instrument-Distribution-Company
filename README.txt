Music Distribution Dashboard - A comprehensive Power BI project presenting insights and analytics for a fictional Music Distribution Company based in Portugal. This dashboard visualizes various aspects of the company's operations using entirely fictional data, providing an engaging and interactive way to understand key performance indicators, sales trends, and inventory management. You can find all the files in this repository so you can open in Power BI Desktop as well as a PDF of the dashboard to give you an overview of the project (without the interactive part).
